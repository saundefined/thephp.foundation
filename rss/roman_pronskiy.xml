<h2 id="php-core-roundup">PHP Core Roundup</h2>

<p>In the <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2022/05/30/php-core-roundup-2/">PHP Roundup #2</a> post by Ayesh, you can find a detailed log of what's been done and discussed regarding the PHP engine this month.</p>

<p>We decided to rename the series from <em>PHP Roundup</em> to <em>PHP Core Roundup</em> to reflect the content better and emphasize that the roundup is only about the core of the language.</p>

<p>Send your questions about the roundup directly to roundup@thephp.foundation or simply tweet at us: <a href="https://twitter.com/thephpf">@ThePHPF</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Ayeshlive">@Ayeshlive</a>.</p>

<p>We promised to publish monthly updates, but something everything went wrong in February.</p>

<p>Thank you all for being understanding about the lack of update in February. This post will bring you all up to date on everything that's been accomplished since our last post in January.</p>

<h3 id="php-foundation-core-developers">PHP Foundation Core Developers</h3>

<p>One of our primary goals for 2022 is to find and hire developers to work on the core.</p>

<p>We are excited to reveal our initial group of sponsored developers!</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Arnaud Le Blanc</strong> <a href="https://github.com/arnaud-lb">@arnaud-lb</a></li>
<li><strong>Derick Rethans</strong> <a href="https://github.com/derickr">@derickr</a></li>
<li><strong>George Peter Banyard</strong> <a href="https://github.com/Girgias">@Girgias</a></li>
<li><strong>Ilija Tovilo</strong> <a href="https://github.com/iluuu1994">@iluuu1994</a></li>
<li><strong>Jakub Zelenka</strong> <a href="https://github.com/bukka">@bukka</a></li>
<li><strong>Máté Kocsis</strong> <a href="https://github.com/kocsismate">@kocsismate</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You might be surprised to see Derick Rethans’ name in the list above. After all, he was listed as a PHP Fellow when we announced the Foundation last year. Shortly after we launched the Foundation, Derick informed us of his desire to focus his work on developing and maintaining PHP's core and that he wanted to apply for sponsorship from the Foundation to make this happen. To avoid any conflicts of interest, Derick stepped down from his administrative role before he applied for sponsorship.</p>

<p>We are incredibly happy that these core developers have agreed to join the Foundation, and we are looking forward to the great things we can do together.</p>

<h3 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h3>

<p>All participants of the PHP Foundation including administration members and developers are expected to abide by the <a href="https://opencollective.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.contributor-covenant.org%2Fversion%2F2%2F1%2Fcode_of_conduct%2F">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<p>To ensure enforcement of the Code of Conduct we are setting up a dedicated team. Tobias Nyholm <a href="https://github.com/Nyholm">@Nyholm</a>, who leads <a href="https://opencollective.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsymfony.com%2Fcare">Symfony’s CARE team</a>, will be responsible for assembling and running the Foundation’s CoC team. Welcome aboard, Tobias!</p>

<h3 id="what%E2%80%99s-next">What’s next</h3>

<p>Our main goal for the next month is to set up a proper communication and development process. We will conduct several meetings to discuss technical and organizational matters.</p>

<p>Since the purpose of the Foundation is to train the next generation of internal developers, we want to emphasize maintenance and user-focused features to maximize our impact. As such, we will review the efforts and ensure the plans fall in line with such an agenda.</p>

<p>We would also like to reduce the bus factor of PHP. So whenever possible, developers will be expected to update the <a href="https://opencollective.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.phpinternalsbook.com%2F">PHP Internals Book</a> to ensure that no knowledge is lost.</p>

<p>On the administration side, we plan to work on increasing the transparency of our operations: to shed some light on the governance structure, discussions, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="php-foundation-stands-with-ukraine-%F0%9F%87%BA%F0%9F%87%A6">PHP Foundation stands with Ukraine 🇺🇦</h3>

<p>On February 24th, 2022, Vladimir Putin's Regime began an illegal war of aggression in Ukraine. There are no words to truly express our outrage at such disregard for human life.</p>

<p>Many PHP developers have lived in or are living in Ukraine, and the PHP Foundation is supported by many backers from Ukraine, including sponsors <a href="https://opencollective.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Foroinc.com%2Flets-stop-the-war-together%2F">Oro, Inc.</a> and <a href="https://opencollective.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmacpaw.com%2F">MacPaw</a>.</p>

<p>If you, like many in the PHP Foundation, are desperate to find a way to help, there are some organizations listed below that are working to provide humanitarian aid to people who are caught up in this war.</p>

<p>We are proud that many of our sponsors stand with Ukraine too. Here are just a few examples:</p>

<p>In November, the PHP Foundation was launched publicly and we’ve seen enormous support from the community.
Thanks to all of you who have already supported the initiative! We’re planning to update you about our workstream activities on a monthly basis, and this is our first update post.
Let’s take a look at what we’ve been working on!</p>

<h3 id="the-first-round-of-applications-is-now-closed">The first round of applications is now closed</h3>

<p>Since November, many developers have applied for sponsorship, and there were quite a few that we would be very happy to sponsor.</p>

<p>We are discussing the details with applicants and planning the budget.
In order to organize this correctly we need proper documents and agreements.
The JetBrains legal department and OpenCollective staff are helping us to prepare the required paperwork.</p>

<p>We plan to complete the preparations and sign the necessary documents in January.
After that, we will announce the list of the first batch of sponsored developers.</p>

<h3 id="how-we%E2%80%99re-making-decisions">How we’re making decisions</h3>

<p>So far, we have held three administration meetings where we discussed the pressing issues.
Each meeting and the decision-making process are documented in our organization on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/thephpf">github.com/thephpf</a>.
For now the details are hidden, but we would like to make these meetings and notes public at some point.</p>

<p>In the next few months, we plan to hold biweekly meetings and work on the foundation’s governance, rules, and bylaws.</p>

<h3 id="shout-out-to-our-sponsors">Shout out to our sponsors</h3>

<li>A new <strong><a href="https://thephp.foundation/structure/">structure page</a></strong> where you can see all the people currently actively involved in the PHP Foundation activities.</li>
<li>Every post has a nicely generated preview image — please, share the links to the PHP Foundation to help spread the word.</li>

So if you stumbled upon a bug, please do not hesitate to report or submit a PR.</p>

<h2 id="php-core-roundup">PHP Core Roundup</h2>

<p>In July, we marked the feature-freeze for PHP 8.2, and this next version of PHP is being shaped by PHP Foundation members and all the contributors to be an exciting release!</p>

<p>Catch up to this month's PHP Core changes on the <strong><a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2022/07/28/php-core-roundup-4/">PHP Core Roundup #4</a></strong> post by Ayesh, where you can find a detailed log of what's been done and discussed regarding the PHP engine.</p>

<p><strong>What if our proposal did not make it?</strong></p>

<p>Among many fixes and improvements, some suggestions did not pass the RFC voting barrier. For instance, that happened to the <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/auto-capture-closure">Short Closures 2.0</a> proposal.</p>

<p>We consider this a good experience in any case, and developers might reconsider, improve, and suggest it in the next release cycle, i.e., PHP 8.3.</p>

<p>We also consider it to be a good thing that it's difficult to change the language, as these changes are forever.</p>

<p><strong>What about deprecations?</strong></p>

<p>PHP has a long 25-year history, and no wonder it has some old quirks. One of them relates to DateTime and DateTimeImmutable confusion.</p>

<p>Derrick Rethans, a core developer of the PHP Foundation, asks for an opinion about in which way this confusion should be resolved; if it should:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Making PHP&#39;s DateTime class mutable was one of the bigger mistakes of the Date/Time APIs. I&#39;m considering to change DateTime to be immutable by default in PHP 9, and to drop DateTimeImmutable altogether (or make it an alias). This is likely going to break some code. Opinions?</p>&mdash; Derick Rethans (@derickr) <a href="https://twitter.com/derickr/status/1551611856007069696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 25, 2022</a></blockquote>

<p>Let Derick know what you think.</p>

<p>We’re off by two but still happy to bring you an update from the foundation.</p>

<p>It's been a month since the PHP Foundation began to fully deliver on its 2022 goal of hiring developers to work on the PHP core.</p>

<p>Backed by our awesome sponsors, six talented folks have already been doing their work for a whole month. Derick Rethans, Arnaud Le Blanc, George Peter Banyard, Jakub Zelenka, and Máté Kocsis started on April 1, and Ilija Tovilo started even earlier than that.</p>

<p>We’ve made the first <a href="https://opencollective.com/phpfoundation/expenses">payouts</a>, and we will continue making them regularly at the end of each month.</p>

<h2 id="how-were-the-devs-selected%2C-and-how-do-they-work%3F">How were the devs selected, and how do they work?</h2>

<p>We received about 70 applications in total. From them, we selected everyone who had significant experience making <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src">php-src</a> contributions.</p>

<p>We also now have a pool of a few other candidates, and we will consider involving them later.</p>

<p>All of the current developers are working part time, and everyone has different working hours. The developers devote 10–40% of their time exclusively to PHP core maintenance, bug fixes, code reviews, preparing proposals, and implementing new language features.</p>

<p>You can follow the Foundation team's work in real-time by looking at <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/commits/master">commits in php/php-src</a> and discussions in the <a href="https://externals.io/">Internals mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to the PHP Foundation team, even more work on the PHP core is being done by Dmitry Stogov, Christoph M. Becker, and many other contributors to core and documentation. We’d like to give a big shout-out and thank-you to them!</p>

<h2 id="php-roundup">PHP Roundup</h2>

<p>We have started a separate <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2022/04/28/php-roundup-1/">PHP Roundup</a> newsletter that covers the development of the PHP core in more detail. Ayesh Karunaratne, the author of the <a href="https://php.watch/">PHP.Watch</a> website, is leading this initiative.</p>

<h2 id="bigger-picture-and-roadmap">Bigger picture and roadmap</h2>

<p>Some folks have asked us whether there is a roadmap for PHP. The short answer is ‘No’. But we’d be happy to grow to the point where we can have one.</p>

<p>The problem the Foundation was created to address will not be solved overnight simply because the funds become available. While PHP is in a better position than it has ever been in terms of financing, this doesn't do much to improve the bus factor. In other words, financing alone is not able to increase the availability of the expertise needed to execute the kinds of projects that would appear on a roadmap.</p>

<p>Financing allows us to cultivate expertise organically, which results in increasing the bus factor. That is precisely what we are currently doing. The only way to become an expert in PHP is by doing PHP. We are essentially paying contributors to become the kind of experts we will need in the future while at the same time compensating them for their valuable contributions in the present.</p>

<p>It has taken us six months to get this far. And there'll be a time, quite soon, when we can talk more extensively about the future.</p>

<h2 id="website-%E2%80%93-thephp.foundation">Website – <a href="https://thephp.foundation/">thephp.foundation</a></h2>

<p>Thanks to the work of Matthew Weier O'Phinney, the foundation’s official website is now up and running. On its <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/">blog</a>, you can find all the updates and the PHP Roundup series.</p>

<p>The site is open source and is hosted on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/ThePHPF/thephp.foundation">github.com/ThePHPF/thephp.foundation</a>.</p>

<p>It is made with the Sculpin static generator and uses Tailwind CSS. There are some <a href="https://github.com/ThePHPF/thephp.foundation/issues">known issues</a>, and pull requests with fixes and improvements are welcome.</p>

<p>We will add pages about the foundation's structure and team shortly.</p>

<h2 id="thank-you-to-our-sponsors">Thank you to our sponsors</h2>

<p>We’d like to give a shout-out to everyone for your continued support, we truly appreciate it – the PHP Foundation is all of us!</p>

<p>That’s all for today. Follow us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/thephpf">@ThePHPF</a> to get the latest updates from the Foundation.</p>

<h2 id="php-core-roundup">PHP Core Roundup</h2>

<p>Here's a summary of what the foundation's developers have been working on lately:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/arnaud-lb">Arnaud Le Blanc</a> revised the RFC and implementation of multi-statement short closures. The proposal is now on vote. Arnaud has also finished the improvements to ini quantity parsing.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/derickr">Derick Rethans</a> continues to fix bugs in DateTime to make working with dates in PHP as reliable as possible.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/Girgias">George P. Banyard</a> has made several improvements to the type system: true, null, and false standalaone types have been added, and Disjunctive Normal Form Types put on vote. George also made a few fixes in SPL.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/iluuu1994">Ilija Tovilo</a> implemented multiple improvements for enums and put a couple on vote. He also made many fixes, like for instance fixed line numbers in backtrace of multi-line (fluent) function calls.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/bukka">Jakub Zelenka</a> made various fixes and improvements to PHP-FPM and OpenSSL extension.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>All developers devote significant time to maintenance, including fixing bugs, reducing technical debt, and making life easier for everyone working on PHP.</p>

<p>In the <strong><a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2022/06/30/php-core-roundup-3/">PHP Roundup #3</a></strong> post by Ayesh, you can find a detailed log of what's been done and discussed regarding the PHP engine during the past month.</p>

<p>This time the list of changes is very long! Applause to all the PHP contributors and release managers.</p>

<h2 id="thank-you-to-our-sponsors">Thank you to our sponsors</h2>

<p>This month we are glad to welcome a new major sponsor who joined the PHP Foundation’s sponsors herd: <strong><a href="https://www.mollie.com/en">Mollie</a></strong>.  Thank you, folks!</p>

<p>By the way, we have updated the <strong><a href="https://thephp.foundation/#sponsors">Sponsors section</a></strong> on our <a href="https://thephp.foundation/">website</a>. It now shows all major contributors sorted by the amount of donation. Kudos to <a href="https://twitter.com/s_panteleev">Sergei Panteleev</a> for this tweak.</p>

<p>Shout-out to everyone for your continued support – the PHP Foundation is all of us!</p>

<h2 id="other-ways-to-contribute">Other ways to contribute</h2>

<p>We are receiving many offers of help from every corner of the community. We are grateful for the offers. There are essentially two kinds of offers being made:</p>

<ol>
<li>An offer of development time</li>
<li>An offer of expertise</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="how-to-contribute-development-time%3F">How to contribute development time?</h3>

<p>The Foundation has limited resources to manage the developers we contract to work on PHP. For this reason, it is not sensible to assume the management of external developers.</p>

<p>Any external developer who is compensated for their time spent on PHP is, of course, welcome to make use of our public communication channels:</p>

<ol>
<li>Email as: contact@thephp.foundation</li>
<li>Communicate via issues on GitHub repos: <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src">github.com/php/php-src</a>, <a href="https://github.com/php/web-php">github.com/php/web-php</a>, etc.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="how-to-contribute-expertise%3F">How to contribute expertise?</h3>

<p>As the foundation begins to mature, a couple of currently unfulfilled roles have emerged.</p>

<p>We will soon communicate the details of these roles.</p>

<p>We intend to compile a list of all expertise on offer; If you haven't done so already, please tell what expertise you would like to make available using public communication channels.</p>
