        <section class="main_body">
            <h3 id="our-pledge">Our Pledge</h3>

<p>We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.</p>

<p>We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.</p>

<h3 id="our-standards">Our Standards</h3>

<p>Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people</li>
<li>Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences</li>
<li>Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback</li>
<li>Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
and learning from the experience</li>
<li>Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
community</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of unacceptable behavior include:</p>

<ul>
<li>The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
any kind</li>
<li>Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks</li>
<li>Public or private harassment</li>
<li>Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address,
without their explicit permission</li>
<li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
professional setting</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="our-responsibilities">Our Responsibilities</h3>

<p>CoC Active Response Ensurers (CARE) team members
are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable
behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any
behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>

<p>CARE team members have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.</p>

<h3 id="scope">Scope</h3>

<p>This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.</p>

<h3 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h3>

<p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the CARE team members. All complaints will be reviewed
and investigated promptly and fairly.</p>

<p>CARE team members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.</p>

<h3 id="enforcement-guidelines">Enforcement Guidelines</h3>

<p>The CARE team members will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in
determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code
of Conduct:</p>

<h4 id="1.-correction">1. Correction</h4>

<p><strong>Community Impact:</strong> Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.</p>

<p><strong>Consequence:</strong> A private, written warning from a CARE team member,
providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an
explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology
may be requested.</p>

<h4 id="2.-warning">2. Warning</h4>

<p><strong>Community Impact:</strong> A violation through a single incident or series of actions.</p>

<p><strong>Consequence:</strong> A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction
with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing
the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding
interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media.
Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.</p>

<h4 id="3.-temporary-ban">3. Temporary Ban</h4>

<p><strong>Community Impact:</strong> A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.</p>

<p><strong>Consequence:</strong> A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.</p>

<h4 id="4.-permanent-ban">4. Permanent Ban</h4>

<p><strong>Community Impact:</strong> Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards,
including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or
aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.</p>

<p><strong>Consequence:</strong> A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.</p>

<h3 id="attribution">Attribution</h3>

<p>This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1,
available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html</p>

<p>Community Impact Guidelines were inspired by Mozilla’s code of conduct enforcement ladder.</p>
