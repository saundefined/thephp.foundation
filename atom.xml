            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We promised to publish monthly updates, but everything went wrong in February.
Fortunately, we are back to give you an update for March.</p>

<p>Our primary goals for the 2022 fund were to find and hire developers to work on the core.</p>

<p>Today, we are excited to reveal our initial group of sponsored developers!</p>

<h3 id="php-foundation-core-developers">PHP Foundation Core Developers</h3>

<ul>
<li>Arnaud Le Blanc (<a href="https://github.com/arnaud-lb">@arnaud-lb</a>)</li>
<li>Derick Rethans (<a href="https://github.com/derickr">@derickr</a>)</li>
<li>George Peter Banyard (<a href="https://github.com/Girgias">@Girgias</a>)</li>
<li>Jakub Zelenka (<a href="https://github.com/bukka">@bukka</a>)</li>
<li>Ilija Tovilo (<a href="https://github.com/iluuu1994">@iluuu1994</a>)</li>
<li>Máté Kocsis (<a href="https://github.com/kocsismate">@kocsismate</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>You might be surprised to see Derick Rethans’ name in the list above.
After all, he was listed as a PHP Fellow when we announced the Foundation last year.
Shortly after we launched the Foundation, Derick informed us of his desire to focus his work on developing and maintaining PHP's core and that he wanted to apply for sponsorship from the Foundation to make this happen.
To avoid any conflicts of interest, Derick stepped down from his administrative role before he applied for sponsorship.</p>

<h3 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h3>

<p>All participants of the PHP Foundation including administration members and developers are expected to abide by the Code of Conduct.</p>

<p>To ensure enforcement of the Code of Conduct we are setting up a dedicated team.
<a href="https://github.com/Nyholm">Tobias Nyholm</a>, who leads Symfony’s CARE team, will be responsible for assembling and running the Foundation’s CoC management team.
Welcome aboard, Tobias!</p>

<h3 id="what%E2%80%99s-next">What’s next</h3>

<p>Our main goal for the next month is to set up a proper communication and development process.
We will conduct several meetings to discuss technical and organizational matters.</p>

<p>Since the purpose of the Foundation is to train the next generation of internal developers, we want to emphasize maintenance and user-focused features to maximize our impact.
As such, we will set up one-on-one meetings with developers to review their efforts and ensure their plans fall in line with our agenda.</p>

<p>We would also like to reduce the bus factor of PHP.
So whenever possible, developers will be expected to update the <a href="https://www.phpinternalsbook.com/">PHP Internals Book</a> to ensure that no knowledge is lost.</p>

<p>On the administration side, we plan to work on increasing the transparency of our operations: to shed some light on our governance structure, discussions, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="php-foundation%E2%80%99s-statement-on-social-responsibility">PHP Foundation’s Statement on Social Responsibility</h3>

<p>The PHP Foundation is in the business of moving funds from one part of society to another in order to achieve our goals.</p>

<p>We are essentially a social endeavor, and we are enjoying a modest level of success even at this early stage in the project.</p>

<p>The administration of the Foundation and its major sponsors agree on our that we are obligationed to disperse these funds responsibly, in-line with our conscientious ideology.</p>

<p>We shall start as we mean to go on, own that responsibility, and take action accordingly.</p>

<p>Ukraine is suffering an unprovoked and indiscriminate attack on its citizens. Children are dying while they are hiding.</p>

<p>Whatever your flavor of politics, whatever your thoughts are on whether or not an entity has an obligation to operate with a social conscience, at the end of the day, we are all human beings.</p>

<p>We simply cannot allow the funds raised by the Foundation to be dispersed without some of it going towards helping the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine; we cannot put our selfish goals before the goals of humanity: to live in peace, and should that fail, to survive as best we can.</p>

<p>The PHP Foundation will be donating to the <a href="https://opencollective.com/support-ukraine">Support Ukraine</a> collective, which is a purely humanitarian effort (inclusive of journalism) – no military organizations will be supported.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In November, the PHP Foundation was launched publicly and we’ve seen enormous support from the community.
Thanks to all of you who have already supported the initiative! We’re planning to update you about our workstream activities on a monthly basis, and this is our first update post.
Let’s take a look at what we’ve been working on!</p>

<h3 id="the-first-round-of-applications-is-now-closed">The first round of applications is now closed</h3>

<p>Since November, many developers have applied for sponsorship, and there were quite a few that we would be very happy to sponsor.</p>

<p>We are discussing the details with applicants and planning the budget.
In order to organize this correctly we need proper documents and agreements.
The JetBrains legal department and OpenCollective staff are helping us to prepare the required paperwork.</p>

<p>We plan to complete the preparations and sign the necessary documents in January.
After that, we will announce the list of the first batch of sponsored developers.</p>

<h3 id="how-we%E2%80%99re-making-decisions">How we’re making decisions</h3>

<p>So far, we have held three administration meetings where we discussed the pressing issues.
Each meeting and the decision-making process are documented in our organization on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/thephpf">github.com/thephpf</a>.
For now the details are hidden, but we would like to make these meetings and notes public at some point.</p>

<p>In the next few months, we plan to hold biweekly meetings and work on the foundation’s governance, rules, and bylaws.</p>
